- Assembly of your torch should take around an hour.
- First ensure you have all the correct parts for the housing.

- Take the acrylic piece with the square hole in the top.
- Lay it flat on a workbench exactly as shown below and then use a countersink cutter to create countersinks where the 3mm holes are in each corner.
- Keep testing your countersinks using the 3mm machine screws, to ensure you have countersinks deep enough that the head of the screw is flush to the acrylic.

- Now place your finsished PCB, so that it sits neatly on the acrylic part. The PTM switch should fit throught the square hole.

- Take the acrylic part with the grooves cut through to where the cells will sit. Put it in place and ensure that _all_ the holes align.

- Take the next acrylic part and again make sure the whole align.

- Next you need to put your cells into the housing. Make sure you put them in the correct way around, as shown below.

- You'll now need some copper tape, to connect the two cells.Peel off the paper layer and then fold the tape so that it looks like the image below.

- Then stick it to the cells as shown.

- To finish off, use 3x12mm machine screws to fix the last piece in place and hold your torch together.

- Take pictures of your torch from three different angles, including at least one where the LED lights up.
- You will be assessed on the quality of your build.
